In GitHub Actions workflows, you can use variables to store and reuse values across different steps or jobs.
 While GitHub Actions variables themselves are static and cannot be changed during the workflow run, you can achieve dynamic behavior by using expressions and context information.

Here's an example of how you can use dynamic values in your workflow:
The Set Dynamic Variables step uses a script (generate_dynamic_list.sh) to generate dynamic values. 
It then writes these values to the environment using $GITHUB_ENV. The environment variables set here are available to subsequent steps.

The Show Dynamic Values step demonstrates how to access and use the dynamic values in the workflow. In this case, it simply echoes the dynamic list.

Remember to adapt this example to your specific needs and adjust the script or command used to generate dynamic values based on your requirements.

If your dynamic values need to be used across different jobs, 
you may want to use artifacts or other mechanisms for sharing data between jobs. 
Keep in mind that GitHub Actions variables are static and don't change during the workflow run, 
so you'll need to leverage other techniques for dynamic behavior.
