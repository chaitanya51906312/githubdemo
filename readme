how to access and use the dynamic values in the workflow give a clear sample solution

Certainly! To access and use dynamic values in a GitHub Actions workflow, you can use environment variables and set them dynamically during the workflow run. 
Here's a simple example using a script to generate dynamic values and then set them as environment variables:In this example:

The Set Dynamic Variables step runs a script that generates a dynamic value based on the current date and time. It then appends this value to the $GITHUB_ENV file, which makes it available as an environment variable for subsequent steps.

The Show Dynamic Values step demonstrates how to access and use the dynamic value in the workflow. It echoes the dynamic value using the ${{ env.DYNAMIC_VALUE }} syntax.

As a result, each time the workflow runs, it generates a new dynamic value and uses it throughout the workflow. Adjust the script inside the Set Dynamic Variables step according to your requirements for generating dynamic values.

Remember to customize this example based on your specific needs and the logic required for generating dynamic values in your workflows.
